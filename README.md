# LP-Store
After the [LP Database](https://github.com/AugustoPresto/LP-Database), now we have an app for a **LP Store**! ðŸ‘Š

Imagine we're in a pandemic and it's recommended to everyone stay safe at home (just imagine...). So the sales are made online, so orders have a boolean delivered variable. We have two types of employees, managers and salespeople. Each role has specific actions.
Again, it's terminal-based and all in Ruby using the MVC pattern.

To store data, it uses CSV files for our four models:
1. LP
   * Artist name
   * Title
   * Released year
   * Price
1. Employee (manager or salesperson)
   * Username
   * Password
1. Customer
   * Name
   * Email
   * Address
1. Order: the model where everybody goes together!
   * LP
   * Employee
   * Customer
   * Delivered?
